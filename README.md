## Source
Credit for the The Weather API source and scrpit is to Visual Crossing Weather. I entered my unique API key and used Google to see how to specify certain weather parameters like celcius, degrees, location, amount of days forecast, etc. It generated a snippet of code, I made the minor adjustments found from Google and then placed the code in the footer of the index.html file.
