        <h3>
            ZZ plants, or Zamioculcas, are a part of the Araceae family, and are native to eastern Africa. The roots of the plant are rhizomes, making this plant drought tollerant and super easy when it comes to care!

    <div id="light" class="light">
        <h2>Light</h2>
        <h3>
            They thrive in medium to bright light, but they are able to tolerate low light if needed! They are not able to handle bright, direct sunlight.  
        </h3>

    <div id="water" class="water">
        <h2>Water</h2>
        <h3>
            Water zz plants every 2 - 3 weeks, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Since their roots are rhizomes, they're able to store their water for longer periods of time.  
        </h3>

    <div id="soil" class="soil">
        <h2>Soil</h2>
        <h3> 
            Indoor potting mix that holds moisture yet also drains well is the best choice, and they do also prefer soil that is slightly acidic. You can chose a mix that includes coarse sand and perlite, and they will be very happy!
