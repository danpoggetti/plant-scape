    <div class="about">
        <h3>
            Devil's Ivy, or Epipremnum Aureum, are a part of the Araceae family and is native to Society Islands of French Polynesia. It's known as Devil's Ivy because it's almost impossible to kill and it stays green even when kept in the dark. These vines can grow up to 66 feet tall and have stems that are 2 inch in diameter.

    <div id="light" class="light">
        <h2>Light</h2>
        <h3>
            Devil's ivy is one of the easiest plants to care for, especially when it comes to needing light. It thrives in bright, indirect light, but it can also grow in little to no light. 
        </h3>

    <div id="water" class="water">
        <h2>Water</h2>
        <h3>
            The best thing about Devil's Ivy is that it's very easy to tell when they need water. Watering them once a week to keep the soil moist is best, but the leaves will start to droop if it's thirsty. 

            They also grow easily in vases full of water! Just snip them below the "node" (the brown bump) and stick it in water. Roots will grow and you'll have a second plant! 
        </h3>

    <div id="soil" class="soil">
        <h2>Soil</h2>
        <h3> 
            Regular indoor potting mix is great for these plants since they're so low maintanence. As long as the soil drains easily, they'll be happy.
