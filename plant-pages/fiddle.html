    <div class="about">
        <h3>
            Fiddle-leaf figs, or ficus lyrata, are a part of the Moraceae family and is native to western Africa. Despite how popular it is, it's actually a rather finicky plant. 

            Fiddle-leaf figs are known to reach up to 6 feet tall and feature large, heavily veined, and glossy violin-shaped leaves. 

            They thrive in locations between 60ยบ and 85ยบ, and they love humidity. It's best to place them near a humidifier or spray their leafs daily with a spray bottle.

        <h2 class="needs">Light</h2>
        <h3>
            In order for fiddle-leaf figs to grow to to their full potential, they require bright, filtered light. Right by, or near a window is the best spot for them! 

            Direct sunlight can burn the leaves, and not enough sunlight will stunt the growth almost completely. 

            Keep in mind that fiddles don't respond well to being moved spots, and it may take a few days to adjust to it's new location.

    <div id="water" class="water">
        <h2 class="needs">Water</h2>
        <h3>
            Fiddle-leaf figs like a moderate amount of water - in the spring you'll want to water when the top inch of soil is dry, and in the winter you'll want to water slightly less frequently. 

            They are sensitive to high salt levels in their soil, so you'll want to make sure that you flush the soil once a month to prevent build up.

    <div id="soil" class="soil">
        <h2 class="needs">Soil</h2>
        <h3> 
            Fiddle's require soil that drains quickly in order to prevent root rot, but also a soil that is able to retain moisture as to not dry the roots. 

            You can either choose a regular indoor houseplant potting mix, or a fiddle-leaf fig specific soil - both will work just fine!
