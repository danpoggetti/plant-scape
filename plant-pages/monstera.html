    <div class="about">
        <h3>
            Monstera deliciosa are a part of the Araceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. They're known to grow up to 66 feet on trees, with leaves growing between 1 - 3 feet long.

            They thrive in humid locations, so placing them next to a humidifier or misting them daily is best.

    <div id="light" class="light">
        <h2>Light</h2>
        <h3>
            Monsteras do best in bright to medium indirect sunlight. Next to a bright window is perfect for them!  

            Direct sunlight can burn the leaves, and not enough sunlight will stunt the growth almost completely.

    <div id="water" class="water">
        <h2>Water</h2>
        <h3>
            Water once every 1 - 2 weeks, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. While tap water is fine, they do benefit from filtered water.
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div id="soil" class="soil">
        <h2>Soil</h2>
        <h3> 
            Monsteras require soil that drains quickly in order to prevent root rot, but also a soil that is able to retain moisture as to not dry the roots. Any indoor potting mix is fine, but if you'd like to increase soil aeration you can add perlite or lava rocks to the mix.
