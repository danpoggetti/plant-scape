        <h3>
            Pitcher plants are a part of the Nepenthaceae and Sarraceniaceae families and is native to the Americas, but other types are also native to Australia.

            These are carnivorous plants, and they make excellent house plants! Inside of their long pitchers, they hold a sweet, digestive liquid that draws in insects and makes it impossible to get out. 

            Pitcher Plants require high amounts of humidity, so placing them next to a humidifier or misting them multiple times a day is best.

        <h3>
            They thrive in bright light - so keep them near a bright window or even outside! Be careful to not have them outdoors if it's above 70ยบ. 
            
            If they don't get enough light, they don't flower and they begin to grow long and leggy.

        <h2>Water</h2>
        <h3>
            In order for pitcher plants to grow properly, it's best to place them in a pebble tray and refill it's water every 2 - 3 days. You will want to make sure that you use distilled water (not filtered water, distilled), as it's not able to handle the chemicals that are normally found in tap water.

        <h2>Soil</h2>

            It's best to plant pitcher plants in a mixture of peat moss, bark, and vermiculite, which is a well draining soil mix.
