    <div class="about">
        <h3>
            Spider plants, or Chlorophytum comosum, are a part of the Asparagaceae family, and is native to southern Africa. These bushy plants grow to be around 2 - 2 1/2 feet wide and 2 - 3 feet long. 
            
            They flower in the spring, and produce spiderettes. Once you take the spiderettes off, you're able to put them in water or plant them in soil. 

            They love humidity, so next to a humidifier or misting them once or twice a day is best. 
        </h3>

    <div id="light" class="light">
        <h2>Light</h2>
        <h3>
            Spider plants flourish in bright, indirect light - next to a window is the best spot for them. If next to a window is not possible, you can place them in a bright room. They will do alright in lower light conditions, however their leaves will begin to fade. 
        </h3>

    <div id="water" class="water">
        <h2>Water</h2>
        <h3>
            These plants /love/ water! Just be careful to not have the soil be constantly soggy to avoid root rot. Watering once or twice a week is optimal. 
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div id="soil" class="soil">
        <h2>Soil</h2>
        <h3> 
            Well draining, indoor potting mix is important, especially with how much they like to be watered. Too dense of soil will give spider plants root rot.
