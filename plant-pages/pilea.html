        <h3>
            Pilea, or Pilea peperomiodes (also known as the Chinese Money plant), are a part of the Urticaceae family and is native to provinces in southern China. They've been known to grow a foot in height and width, but occasionally they grow larger indoors. 
        </h3>

    <div id="light" class="light">
        <h2>Light</h2>
        <h3>
            Pileas grow their best in bright indirect light - so keep them near a bright window! If they don't get enough light, they tend to get long and leggy rather than bushy and full. 
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div id="water" class="water">
        <h2>Water</h2>
        <h3>
            You'll want to water your pilea when the soil gets dry, but not bone dry. Usually once a week is perfect, and maybe even less in the winter time. Be careful not to over water! If you water too frequently they will get root rot.
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div id="soil" class="soil">
        <h2>Soil</h2>
        <h3> 
            Well draining potting mix is best for pileas - a peat moss based potting mix, or even a mix that's for African violets works wonders too.
