        <h3>
            Umbrella plants, or Schefflera, are a part of the Araliaceae family, and are native to Taiwan. This bushy tree has been known to grow anywhere between 13 - 66 feet tall. 

            Be careful not to confuse it with cyperus, which is a different kind of umbrella plant altogether.

        <h2>Light</h2>
        <h3>
            For best results, place next to a window as they like bright, indirect sunlight. Be careful during the summer, the hot sun can possibly scorch the leaves!
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div id="water" class="water">
        <h2>Water</h2>
        <h3>
            Umbrella plants prefer moist soil, so you'll want to water once week or when the top inch of soil is dry. 
            
            Be careful not to over water in order to avoid root rot! 
        </h3>
    </div>

    <div id="soil" class="soil">
        <h2>Soil</h2>
        <h3> 
            Well draining, sandy potting soil is best for these bushy trees! The sand increases the pH level of the soil, which makes them thrive.
